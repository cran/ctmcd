\title{
Quasi-Optimization
}
\description{
Function for deriving a Markov generator matrix estimate based on the quasi-optimization procedure of Kreinin and Sidelnikova, 2001
}
\usage{
gmQO(tmrel, te, logmethod = "Eigen")
}
\arguments{
  \item{tmrel}{
matrix of relative transition frequencies
}
  \item{te}{
time elapsed in transition process
}
  \item{logmethod}{
method for computation of matrix logarithm, by default eigendecomposition is chosen (see \code{?logm} from \code{expm} package for more information)
}
}
\details{
From the set of possible Markov generator matrices, the one is chosen which is closest to a matrix logarithm based candidate solution in terms of sum of squared deviations.
